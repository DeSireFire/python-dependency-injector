   :description: Dependency Injector is a dependency injection framework
                 for Python. It helps to maintain you application structure.
                 It was designed to be unified, developer-friendly
                 tool that helps to implement dependency injection design 
                 pattern in formal, pretty, Pythonic way. Dependency Injector 
                 provides implementations of such popular design patterns 
                 like IoC container, Factory and Singleton. Dependency 
                 Injector providers are implemented as C extension types 
                 using Cython.

``Dependency Injector`` is a dependency injection framework for Python.

It helps you understand and change the structure of the application.

With the ``Dependency Injector`` you keep **application structure in one place**.
This place is called **the container**. You use the container to manage all the components of the
application. All the component dependencies are defined explicitly. This provides the control on
the application structure. It is **easy to understand and change** it.

*The container is like a map of your application. You always know what depends on what.*
